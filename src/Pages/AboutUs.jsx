            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Our mission is to <strong>rescue excess food from events, restaurants, weddings, and households</strong> and deliver it safely to hungry people in nearby communities. We aim to bridge the gap between food surplus and food scarcity through an organized, transparent, and volunteer-powered system.

              Every meal saved not only fills a stomach but also prevents waste and helps build a sustainable future.
